# PhotoContest

Proyecto de final de carrera. Aplicación de gestión de concursos fotográficos.


## Summary

There are some problems with the procedures in current amateur photography contests: this contests usually rely on external websites like Facebook for the upload of the images and also on external agents. They also fail on notyfing the user with important events related with the contest they are participating on. Also, the finale of the contest and the results presentation has margin to improve, as this is usually managed by the manager of the contest and the results are not always presented in a clear and precise way.

Therefore, this project aims to develop a web application that unifies that functionality: allowing the creation of photography contests, allowing the participants to upload the images, allowing the evaluation of that images and finally the delivery of automatic notifications and the results. Doing so, all the data and functionality are centralizated on the application, making it easier for the managers and the participants.

To achieve this, the application will allow the creation of users with different roles deppending on the tasks they´ll perform. The contest managers are going to be in charge of the creation of the contest an the modifications: they choose the descriptive elements such as the name, the description, starting and ending dates, the category (still life, nature, macro photography) technical details like the required format of the images or the data that will be supported with each image and, among others, the details on how the voting process is going to perform, since several configurations will be permitted such as the type of the participants. How the winning photos will be determined and the type of voting will be also configurable.

With this development the objetive is to provide the comunity a free and efective tool.
